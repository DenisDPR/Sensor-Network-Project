 ## DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMPLIFIED SMART AGRICULTURE SYSTEM FOR SMALL SCALE GREENHOUSE FARMING.
               A Case Study of Tomato and Strawberry Farmers in Japan
 
 ## Introduction
 To embark on the current decline of agriculture labor force in Japan, there is need for high cutting-edge technological ICT application in agriculture. However, few small scale farmers are able or willing to risk significant capital on sensing technologies.
In this study, we have developed a simplified smart agriculture system with real-time information ca- pability that could be used for monitoring crop environment, crop management and yield prediction in greenhouse at limited resource expense. We used inexpensive wireless sensor network (WSN) devices and collaborated with small scale strawberry and tomato greenhouse farmers in Tochigi and Nara in Japan respectively.
Real-time environmental conditions were monitored using WSN and daily farm activities were collected during crop growth of tomato and strawberry . We developed a web database to help farmers easily view the information obtained on the cultivation conditions. Cultivation activities were also integrated into the web database. The web database enabled farmers to improve cultivation management through crop environment monitoring based on cumulative growing degree-day (GDD). GDD are typically used to monitor crop development, the assumption being that development is limited once the temperatures exceed a certain threshold. Crop calenders were also embedded into the web database for Tomato farmer( Tomato cultivation is about ten crop growth cycles per year).
A simple regression analysis was done using GDD as predictor variable for strawberry crop development stages and crop yield estimation.
Compared to other smart agriculture systems, taking into account initial cost and running costs, our sys- tem is relatively cheap. The reliablility of WSN data make it efficient and consequently it can be used for accurate crop production planning and decision-making of cultivation activities.
 
 ## Objectives of the Project 
- To establish alternative approaches of ICT development and their applications in agriculture by transfer and propagation of   new technology development through a collaborative support from research institute to small-scale farmers to improve    agriculture development. 

## Specific objectives
- to monitor and collect real-time climate data and daily farm activities in greenhouse during crop growth of tomato and strawberry.
- to analyse crop development stages and crop yield estimation.
- to develop a model to predict crop growth stages and crop yield from real-time WWS.
