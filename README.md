 ## Objectives of the Project 
- To establish alternative approaches of ICT development and their applications in agriculture by transfer and propagation of   new technology development through a collaborative support from research institute to small-scale farmers to improve    agriculture development. 

## Specific objectives
- to monitor and collect real-time climate data and daily farm activities in greenhouse during crop growth of tomato and strawberry.
- to analyse crop development stages and crop yield estimation.
- to develop a model to predict crop growth stages and crop yield from real-time WWS.
